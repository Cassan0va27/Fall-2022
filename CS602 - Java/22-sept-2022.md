# JAVA Swing and AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit)

- Swing will provide lightweight components for web applications

* Java started with AWT then developed Swing

Component -> Something that occupies screen space (UI)
Container -> Screen that contains components (window of Browser)

*JFRAME: Class in package swing
*Everything coming from 'J' comes from Swing.

\*setSize(new Dimension(width in px, height in px))

\*setVisible(true)

- There is a Java class called Dimension, new keyword creates object of class Dimension
  // Dimension constuctor takes two arguments

c.setLayout(null) --> When we need to use layout manager, when pass null JVM understands that component will
be place anywhere the programmer wants

<!-- AKA Absolute layout -->

button.setBounds(x,y, width, height)

- Methods declared in interface are abstract
- Interface -> Skeleton structure, only method declaration not body
- When we implement interface we write the method body
