Inheritance

Allows developers to derive a new class from a new one

Variables, methods can be inherited

Parent class , Child class / Super class, sub class

Child class inherits methods of parent class

is - a relationship (is a child of Parent)

Inheritance allows us to reuse a class.

^ Becomes easy to debug when the applications get complex

## RESERVED KEYWORD FOR INHERITANCE: extends

public class Car extends Vehicle {

}

Car -> Child class
Vehicle -> Parent class

JVM calls the dfault constructor in Java
Getter setters are used to access private variables of a class.

IF the variable is private then the child classes cannot access it, you can use public, protected

Public vs protected ??
Protected only available to class

Problem Given -> Ask questions :

1. What classes are required?
2. What variables are required?
3. Scope of the classes.

Chaining of inheritance?? | class 2 extends class 1, class 3 extends class 2...

# Visibility modifiers, UML diagrams

keyword: super -> allows various properties to be used in subclass even constructor

## Multiple Inheritance

-Needs certain rules as variable name collision can occur

**How to know which class the variable is inherited from?**

> Ans: Object reference created to access the class will help us determine.

## Overriding methods

<!-- Interface is like a class  without a method body -->

> > > What is an interface?

A class can override the dfeinition of an inherited method in its favour

> > > Overriding methods in Java

If a method is declared with the final modifier, it cannot be
overriden

Method of overriding can be applied to data it is called shadowing variables

> Good practice to avoid shadowing of variables

## Overloading vs Overriding

Overloading deals with multiple methods with the same name in the same class,
but with **different signatures**

Overriding deals with two methods, one in a parent class and one in child class,
that have the **same signature**

# Class Hierarchies

### Object class (>> Grandest of grand classes in Java)

class of Object: toString(), equals(), clone()

## Abstract Classes

## Visibility

## Designing for inheritance

# Polymorphism

## Topic 1: Late binding

Binding occurs at compile time

> > Compile time vs execution time(runtime)

Dynamic Binding allows java to call methods with same name but different classes

Dyanmic binding = late binding

<!-- Polymorphism : Same name different meaning -->

# Type casting in Java

Casting needed in Cdplayer cd = new MusicPlayer();
